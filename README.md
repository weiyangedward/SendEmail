# SendEmail

This is an python agent to send emails to a list of receivers. This agent only takes gmail as sender. It allows you to input your gmail email address and password, and send emails with title, body and an attachment. Running example can be found within fold './script'.

TODO:

  1. change to_address to a list of receiver's addresses
  2. use linkedin API to pull down a list of address according to profile that you are interested in (e.g. recruiter)
